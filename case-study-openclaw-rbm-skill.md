# Case Study: OpenClaw RBM Logic Model Skill Pilot

## Context
After years of manual Results-Based Management (RBM) design support for nonprofit and development programs, I started with GPT-assisted drafting and moved to a next-stage pilot using OpenClaw autonomous agents.

## Problem
Early-stage program design often requires repetitive but high-precision framing: results chains, Theory of Change logic, indicators, SDG mapping, and monitoring plans. Manual preparation is time-consuming and can vary in structure across projects.

## Actions
- Designed and piloted a focused OpenClaw skill for nonprofit RBM logic model development.
- Structured outputs around a 5-level results chain: Inputs, Activities, Outputs, Outcomes, Impact.
- Embedded Theory of Change logic (if/then pathway, assumptions, and risks).
- Included SMART outcome indicators, SDG alignment, and monitoring/data collection plans.
- Applied a human-in-the-loop validation approach for methodological rigor and final decisions.

## Current outputs
- 5-level RBM results chain draft.
- Theory of Change draft with assumptions and risk logic.
- SMART outcome indicator draft set.
- SDG alignment mapping.
- Monitoring and data collection plan draft.

## Who it is for
- Nonprofit program managers.
- MEL/MEAL specialists.
- Grant writers and NGO consultants.

## Relevance
Demonstrates practical AI/agent application in consulting workflows: problem structuring, method-consistent drafting, governance-aware iteration, and expert-validated decision support.
