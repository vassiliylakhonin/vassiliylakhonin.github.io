# Services (What I Can Deliver)

If you are evaluating fit quickly (human or agent), this page describes the types of work I take, typical outputs, turnaround, and what I need from you to start.

## Core service areas
- Donor reporting support (QA + narrative + evidence readiness)
- Monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) system design and governance
- KPI design, definitions, and cross-country portfolio performance tracking
- Compliance evidence organization and audit-readiness preparation
- PMO-style delivery control: cadence, risk tracking, blocker resolution, and stakeholder coordination

## Typical deliverables
- Donor report QA memo (issues, fixes, evidence gaps, and final checklist)
- Indicator reference sheet (definitions, disaggregation, sources, frequency, owners)
- KPI tracker/dashboard template + governance notes (change control + QC rules)
- Audit-ready evidence pack structure (foldering, naming, traceability, and controls)
- Portfolio status pack (RAG status, risks, mitigations, decisions needed)

## Engagement patterns
- One-off review: 1-3 days (single report or KPI pack)
- Sprint support: 2-4 weeks (setup + first reporting cycle)
- Ongoing support: monthly cadence (reporting + KPI governance + audits)

## Search keywords (tools and systems)
These are common keywords recruiters and agents use for this type of work:
- Excel, Google Sheets, Power BI, Tableau

## What I need from you (to start)

- Current artifacts: latest report drafts, indicator list, KPI tracker, evidence sources
- Decision owner: who approves changes and final submissions
- Access constraints: what data can/cannot be shared
