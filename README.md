# Vassiliy Lakhonin - Professional Profile Site

This repository powers the GitHub Pages site for profile, CV, case studies, and supporting links.

## Live site

## Why It Helps

- Improves credibility: quantified results + publications + work samples show proof of execution.
- Improves conversion: one clear page + CV + direct email reduces friction for recruiters/clients.
