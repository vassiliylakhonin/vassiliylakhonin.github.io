  <h1>Case Study: SaaS / E-Commerce Platform Launch Delivery Control</h1>

  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>Consultant assignment (Oct 2021 - May 2022) as Product Launch Coordinator for a SaaS / E-commerce platform rollout. Scope included cross-functional launch coordination, sprint testing cycles, performance tracking, and vendor coordination.</p>

  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>The launch required synchronized execution across product, testing, and delivery stakeholders while keeping sprint velocity and rollout quality on track. Without disciplined cadence and KPI visibility, timeline slip and post-launch quality risk increase quickly.</p>

  <h2>Actions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set and maintained 2-week sprint testing cycles aligned to launch milestones.</li>
    <li>Coordinated vendor and internal teams against a shared action tracker and dependency view.</li>
    <li>Implemented KPI-based rollout monitoring to flag blockers early and support go/no-go decisions.</li>
    <li>Standardized status reporting to keep stakeholders aligned on risks, progress, and priority actions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enabled structured rollout execution across iterative testing cycles through launch phase.</li>
    <li>Improved cross-team transparency on dependencies and delivery risk.</li>
    <li>Provided PMO-style control layer for sprint cadence, issue escalation, and stakeholder reporting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>PMO / Compliance relevance</h2>
  <p>This case demonstrates transferable private-sector capability in program operations: cadence governance, KPI-based performance control, cross-team/vendor coordination, and disciplined execution under timeline pressure.</p>
