# Case Study: Cross-Country Portfolio Delivery and Audit Readiness

## Context
Project Management Specialist / Training Consultant at DAI (Mar 2019 - Feb 2021), supporting a USAID-funded portfolio across 5 Central Asian countries.

## Problem
Portfolio delivery required strict timeline control across country workstreams, consistent documentation standards, and reliable readiness for donor audits. Fragmented evidence packages and coordination gaps increased delivery and compliance risk.

## Actions
- Established a weekly coordination rhythm across country teams and central management.
- Built trackers for milestones, dependencies, and risk signals across parallel workstreams.
- Standardized documentation packs for donor review cycles and audit preparation.
- Aligned budget monitoring and vendor checks with reporting and compliance timelines.
- Escalated blockers early to protect timeline performance and submission quality.

## Results
- Delivered 25+ portfolio deliverables on time over 24 months.
- Supported donor audits in 2019 and 2020 with zero findings.
- Maintained cross-country execution consistency and reduced deadline risk.

## Relevance
Demonstrates PMO and compliance-program capability in multi-market environments: governance cadence, risk visibility, audit evidence control, and deadline reliability.
