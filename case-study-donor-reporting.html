  <h1>Case Study: Donor Reporting Quality and Delivery Reliability</h1>

  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>Regional Monitoring and Evaluation (Performance) Manager at DAI (Apr 2023 - Apr 2025) supporting a $14M USAID-funded program across 4 Central Asian countries with 15+ implementing partners.</p>

  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>Quarterly and annual reporting required high evidence quality, consistent indicator definitions, and strict submission timelines. Partner data arrived with uneven quality and timing, creating risk for donor deadlines and audit-readiness.</p>

  <h2>Actions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Built standardized data-collection workflows and reporting templates for partner submissions.</li>
    <li>Implemented quality-control checks for indicator definitions, source documentation, and evidence traceability.</li>
    <li>Coordinated cross-country KPI tracking across 4 country offices and HQ with shared reporting cadence.</li>
    <li>Led partner capacity-building sessions to improve data completeness and confidence.</li>
    <li>Piloted AI-assisted drafting workflows with manual quality gates for final donor outputs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Delivered 100% on-time quarterly and annual donor reports for 8 consecutive quarters.</li>
    <li>Reduced partner submission delays by 40%.</li>
    <li>Improved partner self-reported data confidence from 6.2/10 to 8.7/10.</li>
    <li>Maintained audit-ready compliance documentation and supported 2 USAID audits with zero findings.</li>
    <li>Reduced report preparation time by 25% while maintaining quality controls.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Relevance for Future Roles</h2>
  <p>Demonstrates readiness for Program/Portfolio Manager and PMO/Compliance roles requiring cross-border coordination, evidence governance, risk control, and executive-ready reporting.</p>
