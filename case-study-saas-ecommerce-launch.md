# Case Study: SaaS / E-Commerce Platform Launch Delivery Control

## Context
Consultant assignment (Oct 2021 - May 2022) as Product Launch Coordinator for a SaaS / E-commerce rollout. Scope included launch coordination, sprint testing cycles, performance tracking, and vendor coordination.

## Problem
The launch required synchronized execution across product, testing, and delivery stakeholders while protecting sprint velocity and rollout quality. Without a strong cadence and KPI visibility, timeline slip and quality risk increase quickly.

## Actions
- Set and maintained 2-week sprint testing cycles aligned to launch milestones.
- Coordinated vendors and internal teams using a shared action tracker and dependency view.
- Implemented KPI-based rollout monitoring to flag blockers and support go/no-go decisions.
- Standardized status reporting for risks, progress, and priority actions.

## Results
- Enabled structured rollout execution across iterative testing cycles through launch phase.
- Improved cross-team transparency on dependencies and delivery risk.
- Provided a PMO-style control layer for sprint cadence, issue escalation, and stakeholder reporting.

## Relevance
Demonstrates transferable private-sector capability in program operations: cadence governance, KPI-based performance control, cross-team/vendor coordination, and disciplined execution under timeline pressure.
