# Case Study: Donor Reporting Quality and Delivery Reliability

## Context
Regional Monitoring and Evaluation (Performance) Manager at DAI (Apr 2023 - Apr 2025), supporting a $14M USAID-funded program across 4 Central Asian countries with 15+ implementing partners.

## Problem
Quarterly and annual reporting required high evidence quality, consistent indicator definitions, and strict submission timelines. Partner data quality and timing were uneven, increasing deadline and audit-readiness risk.

## Actions
- Built standardized data-collection workflows and reporting templates.
- Implemented quality-control checks for indicator definitions, source documentation, and evidence traceability.
- Coordinated cross-country KPI tracking across 4 country offices and HQ.
- Led partner capacity-building sessions to improve data completeness and confidence.
- Piloted AI-assisted drafting workflows with manual quality gates.

## Results
- Delivered 100% on-time quarterly and annual donor reports for 8 consecutive quarters.
- Reduced partner submission delays by 40%.
- Improved partner self-reported data confidence from 6.2/10 to 8.7/10.
- Maintained audit-ready documentation and supported 2 USAID audits with zero findings.
- Reduced report preparation time by 25% while maintaining quality controls.

## Relevance
Demonstrates readiness for Program/Portfolio Manager and PMO/Compliance roles requiring cross-border coordination, evidence governance, risk control, and executive-ready reporting.
